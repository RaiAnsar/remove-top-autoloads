A sleek plugin to manage and optimize autoloaded data in your WordPress database, with a modern and intuitive interface.

== Description ==
The Enhanced Autoload Manager plugin allows you to easily manage the autoloaded data within your WordPress database. Autoloaded data can accumulate over time and slow down your website by loading unnecessary data on every page request. This plugin offers a simple, yet powerful interface to delete or disable specific autoload data, helping to improve the performance and speed of your site.

With the Enhanced Autoload Manager, you'll get a clear overview of the top autoload entries and their sizes. The plugin provides a modern and aesthetic interface with actionable buttons that let you either delete or disable the autoload option right from the dashboard. For convenience and clarity, the data sizes are displayed in KBs and MBs.

Beyond managing individual entries, Enhanced Autoload Manager also displays the total size of all autoloaded data, giving you a better sense of your site's autoload footprint.
